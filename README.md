## Withdrawing my application
Hi team! I'd like to withdraw my application as I've applied for the (frontend) subcommittee instead.
The frontend-application is deployed on [vercel](https://frontend-devsoc.vercel.app).
The repo is [here](https://github.com/QuadAces/frontend-devsoc).
I would love to be part of the program, but I'd love to join the subcommittee more, and spent my time doing the frontend portolio instead. If you need an extra hand, I'd love to help and you can contact me at stuart@stuartcutbush.com or via my school email (z5599951). 
Looking forward to the opportunity of working with you!

Best,

Stuart Cutbush
